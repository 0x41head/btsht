## Introduction

I have always been fascinated by the concept of communication “after” death and I do not mean it in a spiritual or pseudo-science kind of way, but more like “if you are reading this I am probably dead” kind of scenario.

Traditionally, people used physical wills to relay their final words, but in this digital age, it has started taking the form of video messages or texts, passed on to a trusted confidant.

As 20 something year old, I have nothing of significance to give in will (maybe my 10 years old DVD of G-force?). I also don’t have money to hire a lawyer to execute my will.

But I still want to be able to send messages to my friends and family in case of an untimely death. So, I did what any software engineer would do i.e. **_automation_**.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
    line 1 of code
    line 2 of code
    line 3 of code


Block code "fences"

```
Sample text here...
```

Syntax highlighting

``` js
var foo = function (bar) {
  return bar++;
};

console.log(foo(5));
```
